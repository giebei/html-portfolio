<h3>
  Before Ever After by Samantha Sotto
</h3>
<p>
  Pick me up books for easy read and engaging story. Though it might be an aquired taste, it's like mini stories weaved
  into a bigger picture that's a treat, a history mystery combo. Drink some jasmine tea, as suggested by our
  protagonists, and maybe some egg related snacks.

  Bridgerton by Julie Quinn
</h3>
<p>
  Discovered through netflix, but as a bookworm, preferred to read it. Noble idiots of gentlemen that act as boys. And
  of ladies that have societal expectations to please. Good series for a quick romantic, and dare I say, comidic
  stories. A classic earl grey, for a classic type of story, with some biscuits! (just don't let it drop on your books).

  Murdle by G.T. Karber
</h3>
<p>
  Frustratingly wonderful. The puzzles are great, though it might be frustrating if you end up solving the puzzles too
  long when all you want to do is know the story. Best enjoyed with a strong coffee of your choice, for a clique
  detective journey you're about to take, maybe some donuts on the side for maximum effect.
